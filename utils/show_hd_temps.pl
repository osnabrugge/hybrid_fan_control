# This script is designed to control both the CPU and HD fans in a Supermicro X10 based system according to both
# the CPU and HD temperatures in order to minimize noise while providing sufficient cooling to deal with scrubs
# and CPU torture tests. 

# It relies on you having two fan zones.

# To use this correctly, you should connect all your PWM HD fans, by splitters if necessary to the FANA header. 
# CPU, case and exhaust fans should then be connected to the numbered (ie CPU based) headers.  This script will then control the
# HD fans in response to the HD temp, and the other fans in response to CPU temperature. When CPU temperature is high the HD fans.
# will be used to provide additional cooling, if you specify cpu/hd shared cooling.

# If the fans should be high, and they are stuck low, or vice-versa, the BMC will be rebooted, thus it is critical to set the
# cpu/hd_max_fan_speed variables correctly.

# NOTE: It is highly likely the "get_hd_temp" function will not work as-is with your HDs. Until a better solution is provided
# you will need to modify this function to properly acquire the temperature. Setting debug=2 will help.

# Tested with a SuperMicro X10-SRi-F, Xeon E5-1650v4, Noctua 120, 90 and 80mm fans in a Norco RPC-4224 4U chassis, with Seagate NAS drives.

# VERSION HISTORY
#####################
# 2016-09-19 Initial Version
# 2016-09-19 Added cpu_hd_override_temp, to prevent HD fans cycling when CPU fans are sufficient for cooling CPU

###############################################################################################
## CONFIGURATION
################

## DEBUG LEVEL
## 0 means no debugging. 1,2,3,4 provide more verbosity
## You should run this script in at least level 1 to verify its working correctly on your system
$debug = 2;


################
## MISC
#######

## IPMITOOL PATH
## The script needs to know where ipmitool is
$ipmitool = "/usr/local/bin/ipmitool";

## HD POLLING INTERVAL
## The controller will only poll the harddrives periodically. Since hard drives change temperature slowly
## this is a good thing. 180 seconds is a good value.
$hd_polling_interval = 180;	# seconds

## FAN SPEED CHANGE DELAY TIME
## It takes the fans a few seconds to change speeds, we allow a grace before verifying. If we fail the verify
## we'll reset the BMC
$fan_speed_change_delay = 10; # seconds

## BMC REBOOT TIME
## It takes the BMC a number of seconds to reset and start providing sensible output. We'll only
## Reset the BMC if its still providing rubbish after this time.
$bmc_reboot_grace_time = 120; # seconds

## BMC RETRIES BEFORE REBOOTING
## We verify high/low of fans, and if they're not where they should be we reboot the BMC after so many failures
$bmc_fail_threshold	= 1; 	# will retry n times before rebooting

# edit nothing below this line
